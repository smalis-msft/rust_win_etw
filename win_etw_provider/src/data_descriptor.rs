/// Contains a reference to the data for an event field. The type of the data is not specified in
/// this structure; instead, the type of the data is stored in the event's metadata.
/// (See `win_etw_metadata::InFlag`.)
///
/// The data that this type points to must have a well-defined (stable) byte representation. For
/// example, `u32` has a well-defined byte representation, as long as there is agreement about
/// whether the value is stored in big-endian or little-endian order. Similarly, `[u8]` and
/// `[u32]` have well-defined byte representations. However, types such as `[bool]` do not have a
/// stable byte representation, and so `EventDataDescriptor` cannot point to `&[bool]`.
///
/// This type provides implementations of `From` that can be used to point to event data.
/// All of the `EventDataDescriptor::From` implementations for types require that the types have a
/// stable, guaranteed byte representation, and that is legal (meaningful) to read that byte
/// representation.
///
/// This type is equivalent to the Win32 structure `EVENT_DATA_DESCRIPTOR`, and its representation
/// is guaranteed to be equivalent.
///
/// # Implementation warning!
///
/// This code is responsible for ensuring memory safety. Even though it contains only simple
/// primitives, these primitives are actually native pointers and pointer bounds. This data
/// structure is passed to the ETW implementation, which dereferences those pointers. The Rust
/// type checker cannot "see" these dereferences, since they occur in non-Rust code, so the borrow
/// checker does not know that `EventDataDescriptor` deals with memory safety. This is why the
/// `phantom_ref` field exists, and it is _crucial_ that this code be used and encapsulated
/// correctly.
///
/// For type safety to be conserved, the following invariants *must* be maintained:
///
/// * The `'a` lifetime parameter of `EventDataDescriptor<'a>` must be correctly associated with
///   the lifetime of any reference that is used to construct an instance of `EventDataDescriptor`.
///
/// * The fields of `EventDataDescriptor` must remain private. Arbitrary user code cannot be
///   permitted to construct instances of `EventDataDescriptor` with arbitrary values for these
///   fields.
///
/// * `EventDataDescriptor` should only be used to pass to ETW functions.
